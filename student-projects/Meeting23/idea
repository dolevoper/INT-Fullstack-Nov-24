🔥 Original Form Idea with TypeScript – "Interactive Personality Map" 🧠✨

📌 What's the Idea?
A form where the user answers a series of short questions and, in the end, receives a personalized personality profile based on their responses!

📝 Form Fields:

How would you describe yourself? (Choose one out of four options – Extroverted, Introverted, Analytical, Creative).
How do you respond to stress? (Multiple choice using checkboxes – I plan ahead, I get stressed easily, I act impulsively, etc.).
What is your favorite activity? (Free-text answer using a textarea).
Choose a color that represents you (color input).
How much do you agree with the statement: "I love learning new things"? (range input, from 1 to 10).
